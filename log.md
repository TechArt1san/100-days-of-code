# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 22nd, 2017

I'm excited about starting, Let's see where this will lead me.
First day has ended. So far its pretty addictive.

Today I have worked on HTML5 andCSS pronciples. 
I'm looking forward to comleting the course!


### Day 2: April 23rd, 2017

Today I have worked on HTML and CSS basics, completed the section. I have begun with bootstrap styling and responsive design.

I have a prettxy good pace so faar, less tha 2 hours instead of 5. Lets see if I can finish half of the course in 100 days.


### Day 3: April 24th, 2017

So far so good. Completed Bootstrap and jQuery. Psyched for a real project. I have finished 13h 20min worth of CodeCampMaterial in 3h 20min, approx. 4 times faster than the estimation. Lets see if I can finish the project in 12h / 2 weeks (May8th) instead of 50h 1,5 months.

### Day 4: April 25th, 2017

Started with my own project, not much progress. This is where the real learning starts. Forgot to tweet though -.-

### Day 5: April 27th, 2017

Didn't code yesterday. Would have been too much.

Continuing my own project.

### Day 6: April 29th, 2017

Didn't code yesterday...again.

Continuing learnung how to work with CSS /Bootstrap. Using predefined classes as well as getting a hang of how to structrue a web page is pretty non-intuitive right now.

### Day 7: April 30th, 2017

More progress today. I'm getting a better feeling of how everything works together. I am still confused about aat which level to apply which classes, at div, at col-md, at the actual component? Or whether I have to create custom classes to change padding and color or if bottstrap itself has everything I need.

We will see. Right now there is not missing much, only a way to efficiently place my rows inside a container, where to set the proper colors, to style and size the different types and fill in the content and links. I guess 3 more days and I'm done (7 horus instead of 50, that would be quite good)

### Day 8: May 1st, 2017
