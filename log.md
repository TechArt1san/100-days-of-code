# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 22nd, 2017

I'm excited about starting, Let's see where this will lead me.
First day has ended. So far its pretty addictive.

Today I have worked on HTML5 andCSS pronciples. 
I'm looking forward to comleting the course!


### Day 2: April 23rd, 2017

Today I have worked on HTML and CSS basics, completed the section. I have begun with bootstrap styling and responsive design.

I have a prettxy good pace so faar, less tha 2 hours instead of 5. Lets see if I can finish half of the course in 100 days.


### Day 3: April 24th, 2017

So far so good. Completed Bootstrap and jQuery. Psyched for a real project. I have finished 13h 20min worth of CodeCampMaterial in 3h 20min, approx. 4 times faster than the estimation. Lets see if I can finish the project in 12h / 2 weeks (May8th) instead of 50h 1,5 months.

### Day 4: April 25th, 2017

Started with my own project, not much progress. This is where the real learning starts. Forgot to tweet though -.-

### Day 5: April 27th, 2017

Didn't code yesterday. Would have been too much.

Continuing my own project.

### Day 6: April 29th, 2017

Didn't code yesterday...again.

Continuing learnung how to work with CSS /Bootstrap. Using predefined classes as well as getting a hang of how to structrue a web page is pretty non-intuitive right now.

### Day 7: April 30th, 2017

More progress today. I'm getting a better feeling of how everything works together. I am still confused about aat which level to apply which classes, at div, at col-md, at the actual component? Or whether I have to create custom classes to change padding and color or if bottstrap itself has everything I need.

We will see. Right now there is not missing much, only a way to efficiently place my rows inside a container, where to set the proper colors, to style and size the different types and fill in the content and links. I guess 3 more days and I'm done (7 horus instead of 50, that would be quite good)

### Day 8: May 1st, 2017

Finished my first homepage. Nice. http://codepen.io/TechArt1san/full/gWWZBv/


### Day 9: May 3rd, 2017

Portfolio page, not productive.


### Day 10: May 8th, 2017

Portfolio page, not productive.


### Day 11: May 9th, 2017

Portfolio page: Making some progress. Still having problems though with placing buttons in a grid.


### Day 12: May 11th, 2017

Portfolio page: Made a lot of progress with the navbar. It's almost perfect now. Ony thing missing is the right color, but I'll wait till the end with the tuning of the colors. Befor I move to the jQuery part, I'll still have to find out how to correctly align the containers so that I have a nice, fixed max an min width....

### Day 13: May 12th, 2017

Portfolio page: Much progress. A lot of good work done. I'm soon going to move over to the JS-topics.

### Day 14: May 14th, 2017

Portfolio page: Working on Color and on fine tuning the styling. What's missing is getting all the colors, font-size, font-style, font-type right for the links as active, inactive, and hovering right (also the normal text H4 and paragraph). Getting the spacing and positioning of some elements right, e.g. background image, shadows etc. Then I'll have to include the thumbnails for my portfolio and some buttons, with svg-icons and a form, also including the right styling for all states.

Maybe 5 more days. After that itt'l become interseting, as I will have to include teh dynamics with jQuery. Maybe some tags will become necessary in order or me to be able to access all the values that I need to manipulate.


### Day 15: May 21st, 2017

Portfolio again.
